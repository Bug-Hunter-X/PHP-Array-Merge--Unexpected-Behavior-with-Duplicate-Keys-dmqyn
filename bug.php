This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to improper handling of array keys when using functions like `array_merge()` or `+` for array concatenation.

```php
<?php
$array1 = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$array2 = ['b' => 3, 'c' => 4];

$mergedArray = $array1 + $array2; // or array_merge($array1, $array2);

print_r($mergedArray);
?>
```

The output would be: `Array ( [a] => 1 [b] => 2 )`.  Notice that the 'b' key from `$array2` is ignored because the '+' operator, when used with arrays, performs a numerical indexing merge prioritizing the first array's keys.  `array_merge()` behaves similarly in this case, overwriting keys from the first array when they exist in the second array.

This can lead to unexpected results when you're trying to combine arrays where key collision is possible, or in cases where you intend to keep all keys from both arrays.

This is subtle because the error is not immediately apparent and doesn't trigger a PHP error or warning. The code runs without explicitly failing but produces an incorrect output.
